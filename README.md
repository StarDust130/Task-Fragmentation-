# 🚀 TheMoonDevs Startup Assignment

Welcome to TheMoonDevs startup assignment! 🚀 This project aims to enhance readability and maintainability by refactoring a medium-sized page with overloaded UI and functionality.

## Assignment Choices

I chose the second assignment option: Fragment the UI into selective components. This decision aimed to improve maintainability and readability.

##  ⚙️ My Reasons for Fragmentating it Like That

- 🔍 **Improved Readability:** Breaking down the UI into components makes it easier to comprehend and manage.

- 🧩 **Modular Code:** Each component now serves a specific purpose, leading to a more modular and organized codebase.

- 🌐 **Scalability:** The fragmented structure allows for easy scalability, making it simpler to add or modify features.

- 💡 **Maintenance:** Future maintenance becomes more straightforward, as each component handles a specific aspect of the application.

- 👁️ **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Components are responsible for discrete functionality, promoting a clear separation of concerns.


## Before & After
